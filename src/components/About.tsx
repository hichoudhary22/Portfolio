          say "Practice makes a man Perfect". So I am on a journey to make
          myself PERFECT. Would you like to join me...? So far I have acquired
          these skills show here. But why stop here? When you have learnt the
          art of teaching yourself "THEN SKY IS THE LIMIT". So I invite you to
          join me in my journey...‚úåüèª
